# McSmoothQ
SmoothQ Gimbal Mac OS client. Its not very useful yet, it's mostly a playground.

The final purpose of this repo is double:

1. Develop an easy bluetooth manager wrapper.

2. Create a Mac OS client for Smooth Q and maybe more models.

### Current status

- App is able to explore and connect bluetooth devices exploring all the services and characteristics.
- On app start up you can start scanning.
- Selecting an item from the list, will connect it.
- If the device is a Gimbal *Smooth Q*, it will connect an open a view where you can use keyboard arrows to manage the movement.

### Nice to have

- Movements with different speed
- Preview bluetooth information
- Better UX experience
